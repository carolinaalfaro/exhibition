			<center><p style="font-size: 35px;">For this project its based on the history of event close to our relatives. I incorporated a lot of assignments from different class. We started off at history where I had to choose someone related who is an adult and ask them a series of questions based on their past. Afterwards we continued with English, where we picked a word from our interview transcript and right an essay about it, in this case my word was “earthquake”.</p></center>

			<center><p style="font-size: 35px;">This second project was based on the industrial revolution as well as the history behind child labor. Both components connect in many ways in which I demonstrated it in my English and History pages. In English, I focused more about the child labor  and argue how they lose their childhood. Where in History I had to concentrate more on the inventions created at that time and how they made an impact.</p></center>
