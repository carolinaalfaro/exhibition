		<center><p style="font-size: 30px;">When working on the timely solution project in History, we had to create many conponents that contribute to it. First, we had to chose an Industrial Revolution invention, in this case it we picked the locomotive and argue that it was best. To do this we had to find articals based on the inventing and write summary. Not only that, but we also included a sketch, 3D model, and a powerpoint to sum it all up.</p></center>

          <h2>Locomotive Sketch</h2>
		<a href="images/train.jpg"><img src="images/train.jpg" width="25%"></a>
		<h2>Click the image to see it larger</h2><p>For the sketch, one of our group mates, Bianca Melara, decided to take on the role of drawing the sketch of the locomotive. She added details of shading which gave it more a realistic look. Not only that, but she explained how sketching something before inventing it helped build a foundation .</p>

		<h2>Click the image to show the rest</h2><p> The 3D model steam engine was made by Macie Legaspi. The steam engine is an essential part of the actual locomotive, it helped fuel up the train. She used many little conponents, some from were she got from a hardware store and others from her house. </p>
