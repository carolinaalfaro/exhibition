				<h2> Click Image to see the rest</h2><p>For English, I wrote an essay based on a word I took from my interview transcript I did to my interviewee, the word was “earthquake”. I came up with my big idea by realizing that many people take their life for granted and never fully taking time to cherish the things around them or spend enough time with the people that love them. While that time, a natural disaster like this can occur and take the lives away of many who might of not appreciate the life they were living in enough.I weaved in the voices of others by adding a quote that comes from a source on the internet. It explains how earthquakes occur often and not just when you feel them. It also talks about how they come in all different magnitudes.

				<h2>Click Portrait to display the rest</h2><p>This is my subject layer portrait that I did for my interviewee. It captures her historical event as well as that things that describe her. In this case, her historical event was based of an earthquake, and she is describe as a traveler. One of the skills that I learned in this project is called the magic wand, which also you to get rid of any background to get the piece of the image you want.  I also mastered many skills like the erase tool which came in handy when trying to blend images, you used it by erasing around the edges of the photos to merge the photos to make it seem like one huge one.

					<h2>Click Image to see the rest</h2><p>My layer subject portrait resembles what I wanted to put on my layer subject portriat. It also talks about how I placed things were they are right now. My composition process on how I laid out the images on the canvas was by putting all the earthquake or historical event photos as a mountain shaped on the bottom width of my canvas, I kinda think of it as a border-bottom. The reason I place them like this because I wanted the earthquake pictures at the bottom showing that there like the past and above them is the present which are the photos of her adventures.</p>

					<h2>Click Image to see it larger</h2><p> What you see above is my primary source photo that I chosed. When first glancing at my photo, there was one main focus that brought to my attention. A boy, at about the age of ten, his right hand was injured, telling by the way he had its position as well as the cast around it. Not only was he hurt, but he also had some dirty spots on the surface of his face making me infer that he worked in a coal mine. With this image I got inspired to write a poem contain three poetry craft as well as do an artpiece that you will be seeing shortly. </p>
