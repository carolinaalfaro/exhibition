				<h2>Earthquake Essay</h2>

				<h2> Click Image to see the rest</h2><p>For English, I wrote an essay based on a word I took from my interview transcript I did to my interviewee, the word was “earthquake”. I came up with my big idea by realizing that many people take their life for granted and never fully taking time to cherish the things around them or spend enough time with the people that love them. While that time, a natural disaster like this can occur and take the lives away of many who might of not appreciate the life they were living in enough.I weaved in the voices of others by adding a quote that comes from a source on the internet. It explains how earthquakes occur often and not just when you feel them. It also talks about how they come in all different magnitudes.

				<h2>Click Portrait to display the rest</h2><p>This is my subject layer portrait that I did for my interviewee. It captures her historical event as well as that things that describe her. In this case, her historical event was based of an earthquake, and she is describe as a traveler. One of the skills that I learned in this project is called the magic wand, which also you to get rid of any background to get the piece of the image you want.  I also mastered many skills like the erase tool which came in handy when trying to blend images, you used it by erasing around the edges of the photos to merge the photos to make it seem like one huge one.

					<h2>Layer Subject Portrait Reflection</h2>

					<h2>Click Image to see the rest</h2><p>My layer subject portrait resembles what I wanted to put on my layer subject portriat. It also talks about how I placed things were they are right now. My composition process on how I laid out the images on the canvas was by putting all the earthquake or historical event photos as a mountain shaped on the bottom width of my canvas, I kinda think of it as a border-bottom. The reason I place them like this because I wanted the earthquake pictures at the bottom showing that there like the past and above them is the present which are the photos of her adventures.</p>

					<h2>Click Image to see it larger</h2><p> What you see above is my primary source photo that I chosed. When first glancing at my photo, there was one main focus that catches the attention of the viewers.  A boy, at about the age of ten, his right hand was injured, telling by the way he had its position as well as the cast around it. Not only was he hurt, but he also had some dirty spots on the surface of his face making me infer that he worked in a coal mine.</p>

					<h2>Click Photo to see display larger</h2><p>This poem is based on the primary source photo that I chose. In this writing, it talks about what the boy does throughout his day, also his struggles in the coal mine. Not only that, but also how he get injured most of the time based on my observations in my photo. Towards the end of my poem I talk about the things he’s never going to get to do, or have based on his living conditions. In my poem, I also used three poetry crafts, alliteration, repetition, and a simile, all were very useful when it came to enhancing my poem.</p>

				<h2>Click Portrait to display it larger</h2><p>Above you see my art piece titled, “The Lost Boy”, it captures the whole concept of the boy’s childhood fading away. I show this by having the boys thought clouds, and everything he dreamed of doing or have slowly fading away just like his childhood. The dark, black background resembles the boy working in a coal mine.</p>

					<h2>Click Photo to read it all</h2><p>In my artist statement, I stated the poetry crafts I used in my poem. I also talked about the three principles of composition I used for my artwork, and how they were useful. Overall at the end I connected how my poem and collage related to my the sources I used in the the beginning of this project.</p>

			<center><p>For this next part, I looked more into how social media affected families. At first, I had to read two articles based on this new project, where afterwards I wrote a poem about how technology create separation among families. I illustrated this concept by creating an art collage in where it captures the disconnection.</p></center>

					<h2>Click Photo to see display larger</h2><p>For my poem, I wrote a scenario where a mother, who just came home from work, calls out for her children, but they don’t recall back. They are to busy focusing on their devices instead of responding back. I also use three poetry crafts named, alliteration, repetition, and hyperbole. They were all useful because they influenced my poem in different ways.</p>

				<h2>Social Media and Family Art Piece</h2>

				<h2>Click Portrait to display it larger</h2><p>In my artwork, you can see at the right bottom corner the present family, since its a portrait you’d expect the folks to be looking forward to a camera, but the children are so distracted in their devices that they don’t even bother looking at the camera. This just explains how children have become so obsessed in the own technological world that creates a separation from the real world. I also used at least three composition skills to make my drawing more interesting.</p>

					<h2>Click Photo to read it all</h2><p>In my artist statement, I included the reasoning behind which compositional choices I used in my art collage. Not only did I do that, but also connected my poem to my artwork in multiple ways. Afterward I summarized it all up by explaining how my poem and art collage connected to the articles I read in the beginning of this project.</p>
